## The currently functioning features are as follows:
- [x] Check if it is the latest version
- [x] get background image, banner, and news
- [x] Start the game / Detect the game
- [x] Download the game
- [ ] Social media panel (viewed in the corresponding data structure of the plugin)
## Planned Features/Incomplete Functionality:
- [ ] Update (currently unable to test as there is no 1.0.0 version available)
- [ ] Pre-download (waiting for the official launcher to perform pre-download)
- [ ] Check game integrity (the launcher does not seem to have the corresponding interface for this feature at the moment)
- [ ] Connect to multiple servers (such as global server, bilibili server)
